# Applied Data Science Capstone

This Capstone is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. It focuses on predicting the success of SpaceX's first stage landing based on variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits. The project involves data collection from SpaceX Rest API and Wikipedia, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, interactive visual analytics, and predictive analysis using classification models.

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Data Collection: Collect data from SpaceX API and Wikipedia
2. Data Wrangling: Clean and preprocess the data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the data and visualize the relationships between variables
4. Interactive Visual Analytics: Create interactive visualizations using Plotly
5. Predictive Analysis: Build classification models to predict the success of the first stage landing

The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The libraries used in this project include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, and Folium.
